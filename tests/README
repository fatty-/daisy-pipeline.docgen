The plan here is to have one folder for each XSLT stylesheet.
In each such folder, there will be a set of '*-in.*', '*-out.*'
and '*-desired.*'-files. The in-files are the different input
documents, and the out-files are the output generated by the
applying the XSLT stylesheet to the in-file. The desired-files
are what the out-files are supposed to look like. If an
out-file is equivalent to its corresponding desired-file,
then the test passes.
